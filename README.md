# Data_Analysis_Sales_Dashboard


## üî∑ Introduction
In today‚Äôs competitive business landscape, data-driven decision-making is not just an advantage‚Äîit‚Äôs a necessity. This Sales Dashboard project was designed to transform raw transactional sales data into meaningful insights using SQL for data extraction and Power BI for interactive visualization. By bridging the gap between data and action, the dashboard provides a real-time view into key business metrics such as total revenue, profit, orders, discounts, and category performance, across multiple dimensions including time, geography, store location, and payment method.

The goal of this project is to empower stakeholders with the tools they need to:

Understand sales trends and patterns at a glance,

Identify top-performing products, regions, and employees,

Track profitability and customer payment behavior, and

Make strategic business decisions grounded in data.

To enhance user experience, the dashboard incorporates interactive features such as dynamic filters, slicers, maps, animated GIFs, and visual storytelling, enabling users to explore insights intuitively and efficiently.
This project analyzes sales data from 6 different countries ‚Äî India, US, UK, Canada, China, and Nigeria. It includes all steps from raw data cleaning, data modeling, and SQL querying to final interactive dashboard creation in Power BI.

This project demonstrates a comprehensive end-to-end approach‚Äîfrom data modeling and SQL query development, to visual analytics and storytelling‚Äîand showcases the power of business intelligence to drive measurable value.

## üéØ Objective
The primary objective of this project was to perform an end-to-end Sales Data Analysis across six countries ‚Äî India, US, UK, Canada, China, and Nigeria ‚Äî in order to:

Clean and transform raw sales data for consistency and accuracy

Create a unified sales dataset using SQL

Extract meaningful business insights through data analysis queries

Build an interactive Power BI dashboard that empowers decision-makers to explore KPIs and patterns across products, locations, and timeframes.


## üîß Tools Used:
- Microsoft Excel (Power Query) ‚Äì for initial data cleaning and formatting

- PostgreSQL ‚Äì for data integration, cleaning, and transformation

- Power BI ‚Äì for interactive visualizations and business insights

- Git ‚Äì for version control and sharing



## üìö Data Source
The dataset used in this project contains individual transactional sales records from six countries. It includes the following key columns:

Transaction ID (UUID) <br>
Date of purchase <br>
Country and Store Location <br>
Product details (ID, Name, Category) <br>
Price, Cost, Quantity, and Discount <br>
Customer demographics (Gender, Age Group) <br>
Sales Representative and Payment Method <br>

Data was originally in .csv format and cleaned in Excel (Power Query) before being imported into PostgreSQL.<br>

## üõ†Ô∏è Detailed Project Breakdown
### üî∏ 1. Excel (Power Query) ‚Äì Data Formatting & Preprocessing
üìç Work Done:
Standardized Date Format:

Raw sales data had inconsistent date formats (e.g., DD-MM-YYYY).

Using Power Query in Excel, transformed it into SQL-compatible YYYY-MM-DD format using:
##### Formula: Date.ToText([Date], "yyyy-MM-dd")

Fixed Data Errors: <br>
Identified and corrected errors such as: <br>
Invalid UUID format (e.g., line 276 in Nigeria file) <br>
Empty or corrupted rows <br>
Uniform Schema Across Countries: <br>
Ensured column headers and data types were consistent in all six files (India, US, UK, China, Canada, Nigeria)


Exported Clean Files:

Saved cleaned files for each country to be imported into SQL <br>

### üî∏ 2. PostgreSQL ‚Äì Data Cleaning, Structuring & Analysis
üìç Work Done:
üìÅ Database Design:
Created individual tables: Sales_India, Sales_US, Sales_Canada, Sales_China, Sales_Nigeria, Sales_UK

Consistent schema with appropriate data types (e.g., UUID, NUMERIC, VARCHAR)

üîÑ Data Consolidation:
Combined all country tables into a master table Sales_Data using UNION ALL

üßπ Data Cleaning: 
Identified and handled null values using WHERE ... IS NULL

Updated missing values (e.g., set Quantity_Purchased = 3 for a missing transaction)

Checked for and prevented duplicate records using GROUP BY ... HAVING COUNT(*) > 1

‚ûï Feature Engineering:
Added new calculated columns:

Total_Amount = (Price_per_Unit * Quantity_Purchased) - Discount_Applied

Profit = Total_Amount - (Cost_Price + Quantity_Purchased)<br>
